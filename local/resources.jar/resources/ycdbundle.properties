#### config task descriptions
YCD_Desc_Enterprise_Data=Define your company profile and basic rules that guide how the application operates.
YCD_Desc_Supply_Chain_Network_Model=This captures participants in your supply chain model (such as your distribution centers, vendors, and delivery nodes). This model is used as metadata for making sourcing decisions.
YCD_Desc_Participant_Setup=These are locations from where you ship or deliver products.
YCD_Desc_Fulfillment_Network_Model=This describes the relationship between various supply chain participants. The network model helps you visually represent your supply chain and provides the metadata for defining order promising rules.
YCD_Desc_Region_Levels=Region levels help you categorize regions. Typical values are Country/Region, State, County, and City. 
YCD_Desc_Region_Schemas=One region schema describes a geography by representing it as a hierarchical set of regions. Region schemas are used in multiple places such as sourcing rules, delivery and installation location determination, and pricing rules. Typically, you have only one region schema.
YCD_Desc_Node_Types=Node types classify your nodes into various categories. This classification is used to simplify your sourcing rule setup.
YCD_Desc_Order_Promising=This configuration defines the rules for making accurate customer order promises. It enables you to set up rules that control from where and when you ship a product. Sourcing rules provide you with control parameters at product, geography, order, and customer level so that appropriate sourcing nodes are selected for fulfilling customer demand.
YCD_Desc_Fulfillment_Types=Fulfillment types provide the highest level of segregation of sourcing rules. They enable you to create "sets of sourcing rules" for different business needs such as "store fulfillment" or "direct to customer fulfillment." An order line can be associated to one fulfillment type, and the rules associated with this fulfillment type are used to determine the sourcing location for the order line.
YCD_Desc_Basic_Configuration=This configuration enables you to select how you want to make sourcing decisions at a high level. When an organization only has one or two nodes from which they source all products and services, you may not need to define complex sourcing rules. However, when an organization has many nodes and suppliers with whom they interact, you need to define sourcing rules to ensure that the optimal nodes are used to handle shipping and service fulfillment. This also enables you to set up default fulfillment types and distribution groups.
YCD_Desc_Order_Sourcing_Classifications=This provides another control parameter (other than fulfillment type) that can be used when setting up sourcing rules. This control parameter can then be passed on the order so that the appropriate sourcing rule required for the order is used.
YCD_Desc_Classification_Definition=This configuration provides a product level control parameter for setting up sourcing rules. In this configuration, you can choose which product classifications should be used for the purpose of sourcing. You can choose up to 3 classifications.
YCD_Desc_Scheduling_Rules=Scheduling rules control when an order is scheduled and what constraints should be applied when scheduling the order. They also enable you to specify the type of optimization required when searching for an appropriate shipping location. Each order can specify the scheduling rule required, therefore giving you the flexibility to have different rules for different types of orders.
YCD_Desc_Landed_Cost=The application provides you highly advanced optimization algorithms that can use landed cost computations to select shipping nodes that minimize this cost. This configuration enables you to set up how the landed cost is computed.
YCD_Desc_Forwarding_Transfer_Rules=This configuration enables you to set up rules that control how product transfers should be handled between two nodes. It also enables you to set up forwarding rules to minimize transportation cost by enabling features such as zone skipping.
YCD_Desc_Product_Distribution_Group=You can define "sets of nodes" that represent a logical group. This logical group can then be used in your sourcing rules. For example, logical groups could be "East Coast Nodes" or "Regional Distribution Centers."
YCD_Desc_Product_Sourcing_Rules_Shipping=Sourcing rules control from where you ship the product. You can define a sequence of complex rules; each one of which provides a list of nodes that should be considered for sourcing the product.
YCD_Desc_Procurement_Distribution_Group=This setup is similar to configuring node groups for shipping product. You can define "sets of nodes" that can be used for transferring products.
